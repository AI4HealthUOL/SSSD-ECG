# Diffusion-based Conditional ECG Generation with Structured State Space Models

This is the official repository for the paper [Diffusion-based Conditional ECG Generation with Structured State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09399). We propose diverse algorithms (primarly SSSD-ECG) for the generation of 12-lead ECG signals conditioned on disease labels.
